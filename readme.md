# Blitz
A simple chess clock built in React Native

## User story

Allows users to determine their game time control, and what side of the board will rest on.

Once the player with black pieces hits "play," game time begins. Each player can tap the side of the phone closest to them to change the active player.

During the game, any player can long-press the clock to pause the game.

Once one play runs out of time, a result page is presented.
